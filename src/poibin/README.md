# Poisson Binomial Distribution for Python

## About
The module contains a Python implementation of functions related to the Poisson
Binomial probability distribution \[1\], which describes the probability
distribution of the sum of independent Bernoulli random variables with
non-uniform success probabilities. For further information, see reference \[1\].

The implemented methods are:
* `pmf`: probability mass function
* `cdf`: cumulative distribution function
* `pval`: p-value for right tailed tests

## Dependencies
[NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)

## Usage
Consider `n` independent and non-identically distributed random variables and
be `p` a list/NumPy array of the corresponding Bernoulli success probabilities.
In order to create the Poisson Binomial distributions, use
```python
from poibin import PoiBin
pb = PoiBin(p)
```
Be `x` a list/NumPy array of different numbers of success. Use the following
methods to obtain the corresponding quantities:

* Probability mass function
```python
pb.pmf(x)
```
* Cumulative distribution function
```python
pb.cdf(x)
```
* P-values for right tailed tests
```python
pb.pval(x)
```

All three methods accept single integers as well as lists/NumPy arrays of integers. Note that `x[i]` must be smaller than `len(p)`.

## Testing
The methods have been implemented using the `doctest` module. To run the tests, execute

```
$ python -m doctest poibin_tests.txt
```
in the command line. For verbose mode, use

```
$ python -m doctest -v poibin_tests.txt
```
